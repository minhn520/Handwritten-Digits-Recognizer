# Handwritten-Digits-Recognizer

This Handwritten Digits Recognizer project is using the train and test data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

I built the convolutional model using TensorFlow Keras to train the data. The model was able to achieve 99.89% accuracy. 

Besides generating the predictions for the test data, I also built a small interface to actively test the model. The interface can take in handwritten digit, 0 to 9 (using mouse cursor to draw on the interface). And then the model would make prediction as to what digit was written. The screenshots of this can be found in this repository (Screenshot_0 through Screenshot_9).
